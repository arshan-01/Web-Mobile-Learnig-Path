JavaScript concepts to understand before you learn React JS
1.	Variables, Number, Boolean, String 
2.	Operators, Conditionals
3.	Functions
4.	Loops 
5.	JavaScript Keywords
6.	Array 
7.	Objects
8.	Event Handling 
9.	Dom Manipulation
10.	State (How State and Setstate () Function Works)
11.	Scope
12.	Class
13.	Extends
14.	Map, Reduce, Filter
15.	Promises
16.	Modules
17.	Closures
18.	Var, Let and Const
19.	Class & inheritance: Class and inheritance are very concept of Object oriented programming. And in React, You will use classes to write components. But it is disappearing because of react hooks. But you might find older codes where classes are used. So, learn it.
20.	Spread and Rest operator: Spread and rest operator are very common in reactjs development. If you don't know you will get stuck.
21.	Higher order function and callback: Higher order functions are the function that takes another function as an argument. And that function that you pass as an argument is called Callback function. It is a very important concept. In react you will use them. Specially array higher order function. Or more specifically the map higher order function.
22.	Asynchronous JavaScript: Learning Asynchronous java script can be time consuming and brain confusing. But its worth is. Once you learn it, your life will be easier with js.
23.	Destructuring: Destructuring simply means pulling your data from object or array to a separate variable. It is very common task with react props.
24.	Arrow function: An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations. Arrow function makes you code clean. You will see plenty of code using arrow function in react.
25.	Data fetching: Data fetching is really important. Most probably you will need some data from external sources. So you have to know how to fetch data.
26.	Module system: It basically means splitting your code into different parts. You export and import code for code re-usability. I believe it is the most common thing in reactjs development.
27.	Npm: If you don't know how to use npm or yarn or package.json, then just do it. Without it you won't even able to use react locally.
28.	This keyword: This 'This' is one of the scariest thing of the universe. I still hate 'This'. But you have to understand it. But if you use react hooks then you won't have to worry about it much.
29.	Pass by Value vs Reference: Primitive dataâ€™s like number, Boolean etc. are passed by their value. But non-Primitives like array and object are passed by their memory reference. This is a very important concept of programming.
